### My Review
This isn't just a comic book movie; it is a crime thriller masterpiece. Heath Ledger’s performance as the Joker is legendary—he is chaotic, terrifying, and funny all at once. 

The movie explores the line between a hero and a vigilante. The tension never stops, from the opening bank robbery to the final motorcycle chase. The practical effects (like flipping a real 18-wheeler truck) add a layer of grit that CGI just can't match.

### Verdict
Absolute perfection. If you only watch one superhero movie in your life, make it this one.
