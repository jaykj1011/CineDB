### My Review
Inception is not just a movie; it is a puzzle that demands your full attention. Christopher Nolan takes the concept of a "heist movie" and turns it upside down by setting it inside the human mind.

Visually, this film is a masterpiece. The practical effects—especially the rotating hallway fight scene—are mind-blowing even years later. There is a weight and realism to the action that CGI simply cannot replicate.

Hans Zimmer’s score is legendary. The "BRAAAM" sound became a staple in movie trailers for a decade, but here it serves a specific purpose, building tension in a way that feels physical.

The emotional core of the movie, focusing on Cobb (DiCaprio) and his guilt over his wife Mal, grounds the sci-fi madness in something real and heartbreaking.

### Verdict
A modern masterpiece. If you haven't seen it, you are missing out on one of the smartest blockbusters ever made. Watch it with the volume turned up.

### The Ending (No Spoilers)
I won't spoil it, but that final shot of the spinning top is one of the most debated endings in cinema history. Does it fall? Does it keep spinning? You decide.
