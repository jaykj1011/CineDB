### My Review
Ending a trilogy is hard, but Nolan mostly succeeds here. The scale is massive—the entire city of Gotham is held hostage. Tom Hardy creates a very different villain in Bane: physical, imposing, and intellectual.

While the plot has a few holes compared to the tightness of *The Dark Knight*, the emotional payoff at the end is satisfying. The prison climb sequence ("Deshi Basara!") is one of the most inspiring moments in the trilogy.

### Verdict
A grand, epic conclusion to the saga. It wraps up Bruce Wayne's story with the emotional weight it deserves.
