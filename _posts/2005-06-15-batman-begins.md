### My Review
This is the movie that changed how we look at superheroes. Before this, Batman movies were campy and colorful. Nolan made it gritty, realistic, and grounded.

Seeing Bruce Wayne's journey—training with the League of Shadows on the ice, building the suit piece by piece, and creating the fear tactics—makes you believe that a man really could become a bat.

### Verdict
The best origin story ever put on film. It sets the stage perfectly for what comes next.
